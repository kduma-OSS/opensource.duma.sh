The server component is a Laravel web application with the following requirements:

- PHP 8.1
- Database with JSON field querying capability - for example, MySQL (SQLite is not supported)
- CRON for running scheduled cleaning jobs

There is no need for redis, as there is no queued jobs used.

## Setup

As this is a Laravel application, you can follow [Laravel Deployment](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/deployment) from official docs.

### Environmental Variables

Whatever you are installing WebPrint Server manually or using Docker Image,
there are few required environmental variables to set:

#### App Configuration
You need to generate app key and fill app url.
Ensure that `APP_DEBUG` is `false` and `APP_ENV` is set to `production` when you deploy. 
```
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=http://print.domain.tld
```

#### Database configuration
You need to set your database configuration. MySQL is the recommended database, and the only tested one. 
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=webprint_server
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

#### Mail Configuration
If you want to enable password resets functionality,
you need to configure also mail configuration.
```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=mailhog
MAIL_PORT=1025
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="hello@example.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

#### CloudFlare Proxy IP reveal
If WebApp Server will be protected by CloudFlare, 
enable following option to correctly discover user IP addresses.
```
LARAVEL_CLOUDFLARE_ENABLED=true
```

### Setup Commands
After you have installed files and set your environmental variables,
you need to install dependencies and migrate migrate the database:

```shell
composer install
php artisan migrate
```

And build the front end resources (CSS and JS) using vite:

```shell
npm install & npm run build
```

### Docker Image

::note
**Docker Image** will be coming soon.
::

## Initial Configuration

After spinning up the instance, go to home page. 
You will be welcomed by a login screen.
As this is a fresh install, 
head on to registration page and create an administrator account.

::warning
**Warning:** First account created on empty instance will be automatically the system administrator.
In default configuration, when there is an admin account, creating new accounts will be disabled.
::

### App Settings

When you are logged in as a system administrator, 
you will have access to `App Settings` menu under your account name.

![App Settings Menu](/systems/webprint/app-settings-menu-item.png)

In `App Settings` you can configure server name (overwrites `APP_NAME` environmental variable)
and interface language - currently supported are:

- `en` - for english
- `pl` - for polish

Also, you can enable/disable new user registration, 
password resets (remember to configure [mailer settings](#mail-configuration) before),
passwords changing, profile updating and second factor authentication.

### Team Creation

Before you can start adding printers, you need to create a `Team`.
You can create a team, by clicking "Create New Team" in team selector on dashboard 
or by clicking "Create New Team" in team dropdown menu.

After creating a new team, you will be presented with an empty dashboard.
