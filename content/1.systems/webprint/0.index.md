## Sample Use Cases

Bellow are provided few sample use cases:

1. Printing take away/delivery orders from central server to a POS printer in restaurants,
2. Printing labels on Zebra Label Printers from web browser of mobile phone,
3. RAW printing to dot-matrix printers from web server,
4. Printing sales reports every morning from cloud server on local printer.

## Architecture

Standard deployment consists of:

1. One [Server](/systems/webprint/server) Instance - Laravel Application installed on server available on the internet
2. Minimum of one [Service](/systems/webprint/service) Instance - PHP Application running as a service on a local server which downloads print jobs from [Server](/systems/webprint/server) and pushes them to connected printers.
3. Printers to print, which are connected to [Service](/systems/webprint/service) Instance
4. Client applications - end user apps connecting to server using [API](/systems/webprint/api). There is [PHP Library](/libraries/php/webprint) and [JavaScript Library](/libraries/js/webprint) for easy integration.

## User flow and headless flow

WebPrint is prepared for a flow when everything is automated, 
for cases when prints are submited via cron jobs,
but also there is a _dialog_ mode permitting user to select on which printer, 
job will be printed and (in case of PPD mode, on CUPS server) printing options,
like duplex mode, color/grayscale or paper size.
