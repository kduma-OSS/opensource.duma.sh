## Sample Use Cases

Bellow are provided few sample use cases:

1. Hosting private Composer repository with your company's internal packages
2. Hosting repository with your commercial packages, which you license to your customers
3. Hosting a mirror of public packages, to speed up your builds

## How it works

First, you need to generate a Composer repository using [s3-satis](/systems/serverless-satis/s3-satis) tool.
The repository will be stored in a [CloudFlare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/){:target="_blank"} bucket.
Then, [Private Satis Repository CloudFlare Worker](/systems/serverless-satis/cloudflare-worker) will serve the repository to the users.

## Requirements

- [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} account:
  - repository for configuration files and running [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions){:target="_blank"},
  - [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens){:target="_blank"} with `repo` scope,

- [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com/){:target="_blank"} account:
  - domain configured and pointing to [CloudFlare DNS](https://cloudflare.com/){:target="_blank"} servers, 
  - access to [CloudFlare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/){:target="_blank"},
  - [CloudFlare R2 Storage](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/){:target="_blank"} bucket,
  - [CloudFlare KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/){:target="_blank"} namespace,
  - [CloudFlare API Token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens){:target="_blank"}.

## Quick Start

For quick start, you can fork git repo for my [composer.duma.dev](https://composer.duma.dev/) repository.

:u-button[GitHub Repository]{icon="bxl:github" href="https://github.com/kduma-OSS/composer.duma.dev" blank}

In your forked repository, you need to update following files:
- `wrangler.toml` - for details see [Private Satis Repository CloudFlare Worker](/systems/serverless-satis/cloudflare-worker#worker-configuration) documentation,
- `satis.json` - for details see [s3-satis](/systems/serverless-satis/s3-satis#usage) documentation.
    
Then, you need to add following [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets){:target="_blank"} in your forked repository:
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - ID of your CloudFlare account
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - CloudFlare API Token with `Workers R2 Storage:Edit`, `Workers KV Storage:Edit`, `Workers Scripts:Edit`, `Account Settings:Read`, `Workers Routes:Edit`, `User Details:Read` permissions
- `COMPOSER_TOKEN` - GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - R2 access key ID
- `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - R2 secret access key

And you need to add following [GitHub Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables){:target="_blank"} in your forked repository:
- `S3_BUCKET` - R2 bucket name
- `S3_ENDPOINT` - R2 endpoint
- `S3_REGION` - R2 region (use default `us-east-1` if unsure)

After that, you can run actions from your forked repository. 
1. Go to `Actions` tab in your forked repository,
2. Select `Deploy CloudFlare Worker` from sidebar,
3. Click `Run workflow` button, select your branch and click `Run workflow` button.
4. Select `Publish Satis Repo` from sidebar,
5. Click `Run workflow` button, select your branch, leave rest of options as is and click `Run workflow` button.

While actions are running, you can go to [CloudFlare KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/){:target="_blank"} and add your users.

When actions finish successfully, you should be able to access your repository from domain of your choice.
