# Eloquent UUID-able

Eases using and generating guid's in Laravel Eloquent models.

## Setup
Install it using composer

```bash
composer require kduma/eloquent-uuidable
```

## Prepare models
Inside your model (not on top of file) add following lines:

```php
use \KDuma\Eloquent\Uuidable;
```

In database create `uuid` string field. If you use migrations, you can use following snippet:

```php
$table->uuid('uuid')->unique();
```

## Usage
By default it generates slug on first save.

- `$model->regenerateUuid()`{lang="php"} - Generate new uuid. (Remember to save it by yourself)
- `Model::whereUuid($uuid)->first()`{lang="php"} - Find by guid. (`whereUuid` is query scope)

## Upgrade from 1.x/2.x version of `kduma/eloquent-guidable`

Add following line to yours models to switch from using `uuid` column name to `guid` as it was used in previous versions:

```php
protected $uuid_field = 'guid';
```
